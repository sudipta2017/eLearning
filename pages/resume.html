            <p>Beside the "serious" work, I also enjoy doing some fun stuffs like creating characters, cartoons 
                and photographs. I try to incorporate them into my work whenever I see an opportunity: My recent work
                 includes a comic series related to Learning and Development which gets posted weekly on my 
                 organization's blogs and posts. For this project, I painted the eggs, photographed them and also animated some of them.
                  Given below are a few examples:</p>
