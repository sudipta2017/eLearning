            I am born and brought up in India. I immigrated to Canada last year as a Permanent Resident. </p>
        <p>I started my career as a graphic designer as I have always enjoyed artwork. I worked for
            media and publishing houses, to create book cover designs for authors, logos, advertisement artwork,
            promotional for companies, posters and giant hoardings. If the situation demanded, I also provided
            my clients with content, which I took seriously later and freelanced as a content writer for some
            educational institutes.

            The shift to the elearning world happened when one of the popular and prosperous NGO in India
            appreciated
            my work in media and content development and offered me to be a part of their eLearning team. I accepted
            the
            opportunity and continued to enhance my skills in development of online curriculum. I worked to develop
            eLearning contents, training materials and designing instructions for various courses. I worked 3 years
            in
            India
            as an Instructional Designer and Lead Developer for core eLearning companies with many clients being
            from
            North
            America.
            Presently, I am a Learning Experience Designer at a Canada based eLearning Company. I leverage my
            extensive
            knowledge
            in multimedia tools to support the course development and create intuitive learning
            experiences for my target audiences. In the pursuit of further knowledge, I am continuing part-time
            education on
            Instructional Design program
            and Adult Learning from George Brown College in Toronto.

            When I am not working, I like to spend my time painting and photographing.
