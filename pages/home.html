    <h3>A little about myself</h3>
    <div>
        <p> I have a combined experience of about eleven years that includes instructional designing, eLearning development 
            and graphic designing. I have been working in the eLearning industry for the past five-and-a-half
            years. </p>

        <p>Award: One of my project has received <b>Honorable Mention IELA 2020.</b> The project was a blended learning soft-skill course: Guided Self-Coaching from Schulich School of Business.</p>

        <p> I was born and brought up in India. I immigrated to Canada a couple of years back. </p>
        <p> I started my career as a graphic designer as I have always enjoyed doing artwork. I have worked in corporate branding, 
            media and publishing houses and created logos, advertisements, promotional ads, posters, giant hoardings and book cover designs. 
            At times I had also provided my clients with contents as demanded. Later, I went for content writing and 
            worked as a freelance content writer for educational institutions.</p>
        <p> The shift to the eLearning world happened when one of the popular and prosperous NGO in India offered me to be 
            a part of their growing eLearning team, where I had brought in some fresh development ideas for the online curriculum. 
            I worked to develop eLearning contents, training materials and design instructions for various courses. 
            I worked 3 years in India as an instructional designer and a lead developer for core eLearning companies. Many
            of my clients were from North America. Presently, I am a Learning Experience Designer at a Canada based eLearning Company. I
            leverage my extensive knowledge in multimedia tools to support the course development in creating intuitive
            learning experiences for my target audiences. I have recently completed Instructional Design Certificate program from OntarioLearn. </p>
        <p> When I am not working, I like to spend my time painting and photographing. </p>
