    <div>
        <p> I am a learning experience designer based in Toronto, Canada with 6+ years of experience in the learning and development industry 
            and another 5 years of experience in graphic design and multimedia development. Through my 11 years of professional exposure,

        <p>Growing up in India and then immigrating to Canada in 2019 has gained me experiences of geographical and cultural diversity.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about creating immersive learning experiences that fulfil business needs while empowering learners.</p>
        <h3>Proud Moments</h3>
        <p>I achieve success each time my clients and learners meet their objectives. I feel honoured that two of my projects have received awards: </p>
