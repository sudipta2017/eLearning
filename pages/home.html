    <h3>A little about myself</h3>
    <div>
        <p> I have a combined experience of a total of ten years that includes instructional designing, eLearning development 
            and graphic designing. I have been working in the eLearning industry for the past four-and-a-half
            years. </p>

        <p> I am born and brought up in India. I immigrated to Canada last year as a Permanent Resident. </p>
        <p> My career had started as a graphic designer as I have always enjoyed doing artwork. I worked for corporate branding, 
            media and publishing houses to create logos, advertisement artwork, promotional ads, book cover designs for authors, 
            posters and giant hoardings. If the situation demanded, I also provided my clients with content,
            which I took seriously later and freelanced as a content writer for some educational institutes.</p>
        <p> The shift to the eLearning world happened when one of the popular and prosperous NGO in India offered me to be 
            a part of their growing eLearning team, where I had brought in some fresh development ideas for the online curriculum. 
            I worked to develop eLearning contents, training materials and designing instructions for various courses. 
            I worked 3 years in India as an instructional designer and a lead developer for core eLearning companies with 
            many clients being from North America. Presently, I am a Learning Experience Designer at a Canada based eLearning Company. I
            leverage my extensive knowledge in multimedia tools to support the course development in creating intuitive
            learning experiences for my target audiences. In the pursuit of further knowledge, I am continuing part-time
            education on the Instructional Design program and Adult Learning from George Brown College in Toronto. </p>
        <p> When I am not working, I like to spend my time painting and photographing. </p>
