    <h3>A little about myself!</h3>
    <div>
        <p> I have a combined experience of total ten years that includes instructional designing, learning and
            development and graphic designing. I have been working in eLearning industry for the past four-and-a-half
            years. </p>

        <p> I am born and brought up in India. I immigrated to Canada last year as a Permanent Resident. </p>
        <p> I started my career as a graphic designer as I have always enjoyed artwork. I worked for media and
            publishing houses, to create book cover designs for authors, logos, advertisement artwork, promotional for
            companies, posters and giant hoardings. If the situation demanded, I also provided my clients with content,
            which I took seriously later and freelanced as a content writer for some educational institutes.</p>
        <p> The shift to the elearning world happened when one of the popular and prosperous NGO in India appreciated my
            work in media and content development and offered me to be a part of their eLearning team. I accepted the
            opportunity and continued to enhance my skills in development of online curriculum. I worked to develop
            eLearning contents, training materials and designing instructions for various courses. I worked 3 years in
            India as an Instructional Designer and Lead Developer for core eLearning companies with many clients being
            from North America. Presently, I am a Learning Experience Designer at a Canada based eLearning Company. I
            leverage my extensive knowledge in multimedia tools to support the course development and create intuitive
            learning experiences for my target audiences. In the pursuit of further knowledge, I am continuing part-time
            education on Instructional Design program and Adult Learning from George Brown College in Toronto. </p>
        <p> When I am not working, I like to spend my time painting and photographing. </p>
