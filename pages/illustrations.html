    <h2 class="py-5">Comics</h2>
    <p>Beside the "serious" work, I also enjoy doing some fun stuffs like creating characters, cartoons
        and photographing. I try to incorporate them into my work whenever possible. My recent work
        includes a comic series related to Learning and Development which gets posted weekly on my
        organization's blogs and posts. For this project, I have created the characters out of eggs for some 
        fun-filled and witty L&D laughs. Given below are a few examples:</p>

                alt="select_the_correct_option">

        <div class="col">
