    <h2 class="py-5">eLearning Comics</h2>
    <p>Beside the "serious" work, I also enjoy doing some fun stuffs like creating characters, cartoons
        and photographing. I try to incorporate them into my work whenever possible. My recent work
        includes a comic series related to Learning and Development which gets posted weekly on my
        organization's blogs and posts. In this comics, eggs are the main characters; they talk, 
        laugh and grimace, and creates a funny atmosphere that lightens the readers' mood and make 
        them receptive to the content. Given below are a few examples of the witty L&D laughs.</p>
