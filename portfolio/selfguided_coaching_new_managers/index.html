  <h5>About the Project</h5>
  <p>
    Self-Guided Coaching is a six-week course for individuals who want to
    upskill themselves to become supervisors or managers. The course is
    delivered in a blended format: a combination of self-paced online content
    and three live webinars on special topics where the instructor will also
    address students’ queries.

  <h5>My Role</h5>
  <p>
    I gathered content by working with the instructor of the course, who is also
    the SME. I provided her templates that she could use to create content,
    assessments, audio scripts over presentations. I outlined the learning path
    for the six-week program and planned out weekly activities, webinars,
    assignments with her. I guided her with best practices of video recording
    before the video shooting sessions. After the content was ready, I developed
    modules and activities week-wise and collaborated with her for their review.
    After the modules were finalized, I supported the client uploading them to
    their LMS. Finally, I created a reference outline for the course coordinator
    to coordinate students’ participation per the learning plan.
