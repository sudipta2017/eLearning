    <h5><i>About the Project</i></h5>
    <p>Self-Guided Coaching is a six-week course for individuals who want to upskill themselves to become supervisors or managers. The course is delivered in a blended format: a combination of self-paced online content and three live webinars on special topics where the instructor will also address students’ queries. </p>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
    <p>I gathered content by working with the instructor of the course, who is also the SME. I provided her templates that she could use to create content, assessments, audio scripts over presentations. I outlined the learning path for the six-week program and planned out weekly activities, webinars, assignments with her. I guided her with best practices of video recording before the video shooting sessions. After the content was ready, I developed modules and activities week-wise and collaborated with her for their review. After the modules were finalized, I supported the client uploading them to their LMS. Finally, I created a reference outline for the course coordinator to coordinate students’ participation per the learning plan.       </p>
