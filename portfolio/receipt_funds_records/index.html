  <h5>About the Project</h5>
  <p>
    Whenever new updates occur in the processes, government regulations or
    systems, the company needs to educate its employees and make sure they can
    follow them.
  </p>
  <h5>The Need</h5>
  <p>
    The record-keeping procedure of the real estate business sector received an
    update in their process. All agents and employees must follow the new
    requirements. But, given records, the employee engagement feedback on
    previous eLearnings was not good. With a volume of tedious information,
    there is a concern that the important piece may get missed.
  </p>
  <h5>My Role</h5>
  <p>I created the module with a different approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I used gamification elements like avatars which employees can choose and
      participate in the course. The intention is to maximize interest and
      employee engagement.
    </li>
    <li>I used animations to explain the information vs. plain texts.</li>
    <li>
      As it is highly required for the staff to retain the information, I used
      scenario-based activities to reinforce the idea that they need to perform
      at work.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To ensure all employees have the information, I suggested the module be
    mandatory training with a due date.
  </p>
  <p>Tools used: Articulate Storyline and Adobe Photoshop</p>
