    <h5><i>About the Project</i></h5>
    <p>Whenever new updates occur in the processes, government regulations or systems, the company needs to educate its employees and make sure they can follow them. </p>
    <h5><i>The Need</i></h5>
    <p>The record-keeping procedure of the real estate business sector received an update in their process. All agents and employees must follow the new requirements. But, given records, the employee engagement feedback on previous eLearnings was not good. With a volume of tedious information, there is a concern that the important piece may get missed.     </p>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
    <p>I created the module with a different approach: I used gamification elements like avatars which employees can choose and participate in the course. The intention is to maximize interest and employee engagement. Furthermore, I used animations to explain the information vs. plain texts.  </p>
    <p>As it is highly required for the staff to retain the information, I used scenario-based activities to reinforce the idea that they need to perform at work. </p>
    <p>To ensure all employees have the information, I suggested the module be mandatory training with a due date. </p>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Storyline and Photoshop</p>
