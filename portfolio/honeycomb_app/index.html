    <p>Effective Systems Training, which emerges to address some business objectives/challenges, involves employees learning how to use the system (or tool). 
        As much as it is essential to know how to use the system, it is also important for adult learners to understand why to use it. 
        </p>
    <h5><i>About the Project </i></h5>
    <p>Honeycomb, a web-based application, is developed to enable search of employee skills, profiles, proficiencies, course statuses, training certificates – 
        all in one place. This system will help the project managers to assign the right individuals to the job and support employees to measure their skill 
        level and plan for development.
</p>
        
<h5><i>The Need</i></h5>
       <ul><li>To introduce employees to this new application</li>
        <li>Train employees on how to use it</li>
        <li>Behaviour change – encouraging employees to abandon the old ways of doing things and adopting the new system</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
        <p>To create training for this app, I collaborated with the stakeholders, software development team, IT team to understand its need, use, its working at the 
            backend, what other systems/apps it is talking with to function and produce results. I participated in the pilot sessions, product development meetings, 
            test phases and recommended user enhancements time-to-time.
</p>
      <p>  The training resources I created for implementing this system are:</p>
        <ol><li>An introduction video to Honeycomb </li>
        <li>How-to video tutorials specific to functions </li>
        <li>Reference guide</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Tools used: Vyond animation, Camtasia, Photoshop</p>
