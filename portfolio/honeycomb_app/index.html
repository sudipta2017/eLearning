            <h5>About the Project</h5>
            <p>
                Strada, a web-based application, is developed to enable search of
                employee skills, profiles, proficiencies, course statuses, training
                certificates – all in one place. This system will help the project
                managers to assign the right individuals to the job and support
                employees to measure their skill level and plan for development.
            </p>

            <h5>The Need</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>To introduce employees to this new application</li>
                <li>Train employees on how to use it</li>
                <li>
                    Behaviour change – encouraging employees to abandon the old ways of
                    doing things and adopting the new system
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>My Role</h5>
            <p>
                To create training for this app, I collaborated with the stakeholders,
                software development team, IT team to understand its need, use, its
                working at the backend, what other systems/apps it is talking with to
                function and produce results. I participated in the pilot sessions,
                product development meetings, test phases and recommended user
                enhancements time-to-time.
            </p>
            <p>The training resources I created for implementing this system are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An introduction video to Strada</li>
                <li>How-to video tutorials specific to functions</li>
