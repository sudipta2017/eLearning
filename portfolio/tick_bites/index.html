    <h5>About the Project</h5>
    <p>As a responsibility towards employee health and safety, this is mandatory training for field staff. During spring and summer, ticks are most active and pose a potential threat to employeesâ€™ health if not careful. The objectives of the training are to provide information to staff about identifying ticks, tips on preventing them, and what to do if bitten. </p>
    <h5>My Role</h5>
    <p>I worked with the health and safety representative of the company to understand the requirement and objectives of this training. I curated content from authentic sources, interviewed experienced field staff and gathered real-life problems that they faced. </p>
    <p>I created the storyboard and developed an interactive online course that provides the necessary information with fun activities to reinforce the best practices.  </p>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Storyline, Adobe Photoshop, Camtasia</p>
