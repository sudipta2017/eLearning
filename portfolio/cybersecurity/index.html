  <h5>About the project</h5>
  <p>
    Information security is a top priority for all organizations to secure
    confidential data and resources from theft and vulnerability. It requires
    response, action and cooperation from all employees to make it happen. The
    company wanted to roll out a mandatory training for the staff to provide
    cybersecurity information.
  </p>
  <h5>My Role</h5>
  <p>
    I worked with the SME and a representative from the IT team to gather
    content, case studies of cyber threats and damages that occurred in the
    past. I interviewed them to gather suggestions, best practices to follow,
    actions to perform by employees during threats. Based on these information,
    I designed and developed the course, created graphics, audio-video
    collaterals, follow-up activities and job-aids.
