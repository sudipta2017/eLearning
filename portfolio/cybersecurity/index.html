    <h5><i>About the project</i></h5>
    <P>Information security is a top priority for all organizations to secure confidential data and resources from theft and vulnerability. It requires response, action and cooperation from all employees to make it happen. The company wanted to roll out a mandatory training for the staff to provide cybersecurity information.</P>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
    <p>I worked with the SME and a representative from the IT team to gather content, case studies of cyber threats and damages that occurred in the past. I interviewed them to gather suggestions, best practices to follow, actions to perform by employees during threats. Based on these information, I designed and developed the course, created graphics, audio-video collaterals, follow-up activities and job-aids.  </p>
