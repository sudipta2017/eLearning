    <h5><i>About the Project</i></h5>
    <p>The objective is to prepare an online training lesson for the auditors to assess materiality. As the subject is complex and tedious, the requirement is to create an engaging learning experience for the learners while enabling them to learn what's required to do their job. </p>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
    <p>I participated in this project as a learning experience designer, partnering with a team of SMEs, an instructional designer, a voice-over artist and a project manager. </p>
    <p>I gathered content and the storyboard to develop this highly engaging, simulated, game-based user experience. </p>
    <p>In this eLearning, the learner role-plays as a senior auditor, tries out an assignment, as they would do in the real world, but is allowed to make limited mistakes, learn from their mistakes and retry. </p>
    <p>That is not all! The learner receives custom feedback at the end of the course based on their mistake(s) or no mistake they make. The experience is different for every learner each time per the user interaction. </p>
    <p>I developed the custom interaction logics, graphics, animations, audio and video content throughout the module. </p>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Storyline, JavaScript, Vyond animation, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Audition</p>
    <p>Feel free to take part in a demo experience. </p>
