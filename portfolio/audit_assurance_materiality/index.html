  <h5>About the Project</h5>
  <p>
    The objective is to prepare an online training lesson for the auditors to
    assess materiality. As the subject is complex and tedious, the requirement
    is to create an engaging learning experience for the learners while enabling
    them to learn what's required to do their job.

  <h5>My Role</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I participated in this project as a learning experience designer,
      partnering with a team of SMEs, an instructional designer, a voice-over
      artist and a project manager.
    </li>
    <li>
      I gathered content and the storyboard to develop this highly engaging,
      simulated, game-based user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      In this eLearning, the learner role-plays as a senior auditor, tries out
      an assignment, as they would do in the real world, but is allowed to make
      limited mistakes, learn from their mistakes and retry.
    </li>
    <li>
      That is not all! The learner receives custom feedback at the end of the
      course based on their mistake(s) or no mistake they make. The experience
      is different for every learner each time per the user interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      I developed the custom interaction logics, graphics, animations, audio and
      video content throughout the module.
