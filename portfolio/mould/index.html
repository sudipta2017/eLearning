  <h5>Project Background</h5>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Initially, a 2-day seminar, led by experts before the pandemic to empower
    employees with the standard procedures, methods, health and safety
    guidelines, tips and tricks from their long-time experience, converted into
    webinar sessions in the new-normal environment. The objective remains same:
    prepare the staff to effectively do their job.
  </p>

  <p>
    The SMEs felt that webinars were not as effective because they were probably
    not getting the total attention of the attendees as they may be passively
    listening to them (and maybe doing other tasks at side). The concern was
    that people were making mistakes at work.
  </p>
  <h5>My Role</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg">
      <p>I suggested having a blended approach:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A self-paced online course with multiple modules to cover the
          information, case studies, knowledge checks at intervals to encourage
          their cognitive involvement and a final assessment at the end of the
          course
        </li>
        <li>
          A monthly one-hour virtual session – “Ask The Experts” with the SMEs,
          where employees (existing and new) can register and SMEs will answer
          their queries.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I collaborated with the SMEs to design storyboards, interviewed them to
        gather information, supported them in recording their voice that I used
        within the modules, created assessment templates, created multimedia,
        developed the course and launched it.
      </p>
      <p>Training resources created:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A course consisting of 5 online modules</li>
        <li>Final Assessment</li>
        <li>Job-aids to download and use as reference when needed</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Tools used: Articulate Rise, Vyond animation, Photoshop, Camtasia</p>

    <div class="col-lg">

  <h5>Result</h5>
  <p>
    Employees were able to take responsibility for their training and validate
    their knowledge through assessments. After they took the online course,
    employees were proactive and specific with queries during the virtual
    session.
  </p>
  <p>
    SMEs spent time only answering queries and sharing valuable experiences (and
    not repeating information) during live sessions. It helped free up their
    time for other tasks. The error rate was significantly reduced.
