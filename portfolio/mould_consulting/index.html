    <h5><i>Background </i></h5>
    <p>Initially, a 2-day seminar, led by industry experts before the pandemic to empower employees with the standard procedures, methods, health and safety guidelines, tips and tricks from their long-time experience, went into repetitive webinar sessions in the new-normal approach. The objective is to transfer information to the staff so that they can effectively do their job. </p>
    <h5><i>The Problem</i></h5>
    <p>The SMEs felt that webinars were not as effective because they were probably not getting the total attention of the attendees as they may be passively listening to them (and maybe doing other tasks side-by-side). The concern was that people were making mistakes at work. Plus, the SMEs were ending up doing more webinars compared to the time they organized seminars.</p>
    <h5><i>My Role & Solution</i></h5>
    <p>I suggested having a blended approach: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A self-paced online course for learning the information, safety protocols, case studies, and participating in knowledge checks at intervals to encourage their cognitive involvement and a final assessment at the end of the course </li>
        <li>A monthly one-hour virtual session – “Ask The Experts” where employees (existing and new) register and SMEs answer their questions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Employees were able to take responsibility for their training and validate their knowledge through assessments. SMEs spent time only to answer queries and share valuable experiences (and not repeat information) during live sessions once a month. It helped free up their time for other tasks. </p>
    <p>I collaborated with the SMEs to design storyboards, interviewed them to gather information, supported them in recording their voice that I used within the modules, created assessment templates, created multimedia, developed the course and launched it.</p>
    <p>Training resources created:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A course consisting of 5 online modules </li>
        <li>Final Assessment </li>
        <li>Job-aids to download and use as reference when needed</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Rise, Vyond animation, Photoshop, Camtasia</p>
