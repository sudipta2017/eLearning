    <h5>About the Project</h5>
    <p>Wetland delineation is a part of the environmental assessment services that the company provides to clients. The objective is to train the staff for their job.</p>
    <h5>The Requirement</h5>
    <p>A standard procedure needs to be followed by all employees of the practice area to maintain quality and consistency across all offices in Canada. The managers do their best informally coaching their staff however, there was no formal training due to which misses had happened in the past, and the processes were not consistent since they were not clearly outlined. Moreover, new members joining the team had to wait to get the information from their colleagues or supervisors. It sometimes created confusion; the SMEs had thought to lay some guidelines to avoid them, but couldn't manage time to materialize it. </p>

    <h5>My Role</h5>
    <p>I worked with the SMEs to get the content. As they didn’t have any content ready for direct use and neither had time to create some, I participated in their next team meetings where they were preparing their new team members for the job. I requested the organizer to record the session so that I can use it for my reference later. I used these recorded video sessions as my content source and created an online learning module. Once developed, I sent them for SME reviews, and they helped me validate/update the information where needed. </p>

    <p>Training resources created:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Online training module </li>
        <li>Downloadable reference guides</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Rise, Vyond animation, Photoshop, Camtasia</p>
    <h5>Result</h5>
    <p>Without a major involvement of the SMEs’ time and additional resources, the training was ready for employees (existing and new) across all offices in Canada. They were able to access the reference resources from their laptops, mobile devices whenever they needed them. Everyone in the organization was able to follow and refer to one standard guideline. It helped avoid confusion at work. </p>
