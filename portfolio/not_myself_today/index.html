    <h5><i>About the Project</i></h5>
    <p>It is an initiative to build greater awareness and understanding of mental health among the workforce, reducing stigma and fostering safe and supportive work culture. </p>
    <h5><i>My Role</i></h5>
    <p>I have prepared an introduction video to introduce the program to the employees, gathering content provided by the Canadian Mental Health Association. </p>
    <p>CMHA provides some practice activities and game ideas to play during team meetings. Some of them are in-person, which becomes useless for them working from home. I converted these games into online activities. </p>
    <p>Tools used: Vyond Animation, Articulate Storyline</p>
