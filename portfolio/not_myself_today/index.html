  <h5>About the Project</h5>
  <p>
    It is an initiative to build greater awareness and understanding of mental
    health among the workforce, reducing stigma and fostering safe and
    supportive work culture.
  </p>
  <h5>My Role</h5>
  <p>
    I have prepared an introduction video to introduce the program to the
    employees, gathering content provided by the Canadian Mental Health
    Association.

    CMHA provides some practice activities and game ideas to play during team
    meetings. Some of them are in-person, which becomes useless for them working
    from home. I converted these games into online activities.
