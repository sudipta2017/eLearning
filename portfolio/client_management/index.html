    <h5>About the Project</h5>
    <p>The objective of this training development is to support and prepare all new managers for their new roles. It discusses strategies for client management and best practices for building client relationships. This training also intends to standardize the approach to deal with customer requests, problem situations, service commitments, and ad-hoc requests across all offices to promote the brand value and culture. </p>
    <h5>My Role</h5>
    <p>I collaborated with the SME and gathered content, insight, case studies, practice scenarios. </p>
    <p>I designed and developed the course: designed graphics and other visual content, prepared activities that could help new managers gain some confidence and follow the industry best practices at work. To retain authenticity, I recommended using SMEâ€™s voice over the video content. I helped him record his script that I later used with video animations.  </p>
    <p>Tools used: Articulate Rise, Adobe Photoshop, Camtasia, Vyond Animations</p>
