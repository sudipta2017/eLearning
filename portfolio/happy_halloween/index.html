    <h5>About the Project</h5>

    <p>Amidst fun and laughter, itâ€™s that time of the year that can also bring serious safety risks when children are out after the sun is down, 
        and there are lights and candles decorated in open areas with some scary figures. </p>
      <p> The goal is to provide a reminder to the adults to plan ahead for safety on halloween, and have fun while keeping their family and community safe.</p>
    <p>This microlearning is created in <i>7taps</i>.</p>
