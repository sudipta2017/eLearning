      <p>
        Amidst fun and laughter, itâ€™s that time of the year that can also bring
        serious safety risks when children are out after the sun is down, and
        there are lights and candles decorated in open areas with some scary
        figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to provide a reminder to the adults to plan ahead for safety
        on halloween, and have fun while keeping their family and community
        safe.
