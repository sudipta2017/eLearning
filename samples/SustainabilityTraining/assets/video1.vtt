00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Sustainability. It's a term you may or may not have heard of, but it's becoming

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.100
more important for companies and organizations of all sizes across all

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.000
industries.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.710
We hope you'll know more about sustainability and what it means for your

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.000
organization by the end of this module.

Hi, my name is Dan and I will be your partner in this journey. Thanks for

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.000
joining us to learn about sustainability.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.460
What is sustainability? It's basically all about striving to balance our needs

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.000
today against those of future generations.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In terms of the natural resources, our planet can provide.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.050
For corporations, sustainability is not about how a company uses its profits,

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.000
but how it makes money in the first place.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.830
Now I have a little activity for you. What do you think sustainability programs

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.000
should focus on?

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.380
Pick the activities below that companies should include in their sustainability

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.000
efforts.
